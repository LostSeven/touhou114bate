At this point, the puppet workshop has completed the adaptation without losing any strength. As of press time, Feng Jian Youxiang has not yet expressed any opinion on this matter. Although Maddie Xin stated that Alice had been killed by herself, the reporter had seen a similar figure in the sunflower field while attempting to interview Feng Jian Youxiang, so she did not comment much"

In addition, the reporter found that since the completion of the brewery, all the people of the entire ghost tribe have flocked to the brewery to taste the newly brewed wine, causing a situation of crowds.

 news.1006.d:0 "The framework of the cooperation agreement for the Hell Furnace of the Earth Spirit Hall, which has been receiving much attention, was finally officially released yesterday. The Hell Furnace is the foundation for the survival of the Earth Spirit Hall and even the entire old hell. After abandoning the old hell on the other side due to the implementation of hell miniaturization, it was built at a huge cost by the Jue Monster and has been guarding it from the other side until now. However, it is surprising that the Hell Furnace, which is so important, is willing to be shared by the Earth Spirit Hall. The report sent by frontline reporters shows that the Earth Spirit Hall is willing to share the energy produced by the Hell Furnace with other forces except for the other side and the White Jade Tower, in exchange for shelter and living space. Although several forces have previously expressed their continued interest in the agreement, no force has officially given a positive response. It is speculated that on the one hand, there is concern about the attitude of the other side, and on the other hand, there are still doubts about this matter and they are keeping a wait-and-see attitude"

From then on, the previously rumored 'Jue Monster Migration Plan' officially surfaced. According to relevant sources, this move is not surprising, mainly because the environment of the old hell is not particularly suitable for the survival of Jue monsters. Although it is not bad, it is definitely not comfortable. In order to revive Jue monsters and expand their population, they must migrate to more comfortable places. Although there have been no further actions taken by the Earth Spirit Hall since the announcement, there is evidence to suggest that they are actively expanding their military capabilities and are likely to take action soon"

According to frontline reporters, there was nothing particularly special about this tribute, and even the scale was reduced compared to before the mutation, but this did not prevent Tengu from promoting it vigorously. According to relevant personnel analysis, the political significance of this ceremony far outweighs its practical significance. The main purpose is to announce to the entire fantasy village that Tengu still holds onto Hetong firmly, and Hetong has no plans to change this situation"

The Hetong delegation this time is the first independent contact between Hetong and other forces. At present, the reason for this change is still unclear, but it can be foreseen that Hetong is trying to weaken the control of Tengu and make contact with other forces in the fantasy village independently"

Although the reason for Bai Yulou's absence is still unclear, it undoubtedly increases suspicion from the outside world. Previously, a relevant person analyzed; 'Given the close relationship between the current leader of Baiyulou and a certain sage in the Fantasy Township Wise Council, Baiyulou is very likely to take this opportunity to break free from the control of the other side and join the embrace of the Wise Council.' According to the latest information, there have been suspected wise individuals entering and leaving Baiyulou recently, but Baiyulou has refused to respond to this"

Unlike the previous Fantasia Conference hosted by the Wise Men's Council, the main members of this meeting are experts who have dealt with mutations in the past, and the topics mainly revolve around solving the world's transformation and how to maintain order in this situation. Although the Hakurei Shrine has made tremendous efforts in all aspects, the talks have had little effect, and in the newly started round of negotiations, the attendance rate is even lower than half. At present, apart from the Hakurei Shrine, only the Xianglin Hall has a positive attitude, while the people are trying to seek refuge and have a cold attitude towards maintaining order. According to insiders, Alice also left the workshop very rarely and attended the meeting, reaching an agreement with the Hakurei Shrine on certain issues. However, Alice herself has not yet made a public appearance and has not given any response to the rumor"

However, the reporter found that due to the current tense situation, although various forces are highly concerned about this grand event, their attitude towards participation is indifferent. The vast majority of exhibition areas are just some commonplace small things, and some exhibition areas are even empty. Nevertheless, this expo still became the focal point of the entire Fantasia with only three active exhibition areas. The Eternal Pavilion exhibition area, with the ultra modern technology of Yuedu, provides people with a dream like experience; Although Alice herself was unable to attend, the puppet workshop exhibition area led by Penglai has the largest number of staff and no other equipment. With dolls alone, it is possible to achieve nanometer level accuracy, which makes people marvel at the power of electronic technology and automation; The exhibition area of Hetong fully embodies the charm of heavy equipment, with the largest floor area among all exhibition areas, and it can be filled with heavy equipment without waste. The only drawback is the need to wear special protective clothing provided by Hetong and be prepared for explosions at any time"

The spokesperson of Yongting responded that this is only a military exercise conducted to protect themselves in response to the current tense situation. However, the reporter found a large number of traces of large-scale mobilization of heavy armed forces, and the spokesperson of Yongting still insists that it is only a military exercise and there is no rhetoric against anyone"

At present, the purpose of this move is not clear, although there are signs of military mobilization, it is concentrated towards Yongting, so the possibility of attacking other forces is not high. According to relevant sources' analysis, when the world first entered, abnormal fluctuations in space were observed in the Eternal Pavilion, and this series of abnormal behaviors in the Eternal Pavilion are likely related to it"

As one of the few forces in Fantasia with the ability to hold the largest banquet, the Red Magic Pavilion held multiple banquets before the world entered, so this grand banquet also received widespread response. According to relevant sources' analysis, the Red Magic Pavilion opened its base to hold a grand banquet in such a tense environment to convey a signal to the outside world that it prefers fine wine over blood. Although the Red Magic Pavilion has always been a strong competitor for the hegemony of the demon power, judging from the banquet, they no longer have any plans to continue competing for supremacy"

However, earlier on, Saint Shirakawa, the abbot of Myori Temple, used the cable car provided by Shouya to return to Myori Temple via Shouya, becoming the first infidels to use Shouya's facilities. In fact, the Myojin Temple is not located near the Shouya Shrine. Passing through the Shouya Shrine will only increase the distance in vain, so this move has no practical significance. However, its symbolic significance is unprecedentedly enormous. Ms. Sh ō Shirakawa expressed that she is willing to believe that the actions of the Shouya Shrine are out of goodwill and is willing to prove it. This has also led to a new interpretation of the purpose of the Shouya Shrine policy by the outside world"

The reporter learned that the tour route of this sightseeing group mainly focuses on the outskirts of Monster Mountain and will not enter deeper areas. Related scholars say that this is an attempt by Tengu to change the completely closed and exclusive status quo of Tengu society. Monster Mountain has always been known for its beautiful scenery and the fact that once you step in, you will be immediately expelled by Tengu. Therefore, it is surprising that Tengu took the initiative to invite foreigners to visit. In addition, our reporter found during our visit that there are many dissatisfied people in the Tengu Camp. Perhaps it is precisely because of this that the tour group chose the outer route. It seems that Tengu still needs some time to work hard to complete the opening"

All foreigners in Monster Mountain are expelled, and the freedom to use non lethal weapons and the limited threat of using lethal weapons are open to unarmed personnel.

After the reporter's visit, it was found that the vast majority of these Taoist priests come from the temple of gods and are practitioners of the temple. These Taoists provide assistance to humans regardless of their power, while persuading them to stay away from monsters, and even when facing monsters, they maintain great restraint. The Taoists had been practicing in seclusion in the temple of gods before, taking it as their duty to become immortals and never caring about worldly affairs.

Human beings have always been the focus of competition among various forces, with monsters feeding on the fear they produce, and religious factions relying on them to provide faith and disciples. Of course, compared to monsters, people are more welcoming to religious forces that are also human. According to relevant sources' analysis, this move by Renli is mainly a self-defense measure against the escalating tension recently, by showing goodwill to major religious sects in order to gain greater support. However, in the current situation, major forces are struggling to protect themselves and cannot determine how much positive effect this move will bring. It can be foreseen that further actions will be taken within the people to win over all parties"

The spokesperson stated that this is a significant progress within the community. However, major religious forces have expressed that this is disrespectful to the gods. However, regardless, the bill has been officially promulgated among the people and is steadily progressing. According to insiders, this move by the people aims to change their previous situation of being controlled by others.

Before the establishment of the Doll Workshop, Alice was renowned throughout Fantasia for her stunning doll creations. There were also rumors that Alice's own beauty was not inferior to her dolls, but due to the dangerous environment of the Magic Forest, few people were able to see her true form. Later, the doll workshop was established, and Alice's dolls gradually began to enter the public eye, becoming one of the top gifts in high society. However, due to all the dolls being handmade by Alice herself, they have always been in short supply. According to incomplete statistics, the number of gifts presented this time is even larger than the total number sold or given away by doll workshops in the past decade. Although doll workshops have a tradition of giving doll gifts before, such a large scale is unprecedented. According to relevant sources' analysis, Alice's move is intended to ease the current tense situation as much as possible, and it is also a powerful counterattack against the widely circulated rumor that Alice has died recently"

Additionally, all eyewitnesses have stated that those dolls face outward and closely monitor everything that comes and goes. When someone notices them, they disappear at some point and return to the vicinity of the discovery site a few days later, although they often change positions and become more difficult to spot. Even some restricted or highly confidential areas have witnessed testimonies. At present, in order to avoid further leaks, several forces have started to search for these dolls. It's hard to imagine that such organized action would be spontaneous, but the puppet workshop still stated that it had nothing to do with it"

This grand occasion reminds me of the days when the Supreme Leader led his confidants on a tour of Fantasia and had friendly exchanges with heroes. Although there were occasional conflicts, they relied on the great charisma of the leader to win over people with virtue. Every time they visited a place, the locals would welcome them through the streets. The only one who can lead us is the Supreme Leader. Long live the leader! hooray! Ten thousand years old! In addition, all the rumors of protests, riots, rallies, etc. that you have heard are groundless. There is no one in the fantasy village who does not support the newly appointed supreme leader. What you hear at home is not the sound of gunshots or cannons, but the excited people setting off firecrackers to celebrate, and the soaring flames are the bonfires of celebration. This newspaper kindly reminds readers to stay indoors, close doors and windows tightly. No matter how excited they are, please do not join the carnival outside until the new government's army takes you out of your house. Thank you for your cooperation"

According to an anonymous source, the Council of Wise Men had identified potential signs that could have led to the current situation a long time ago, but did not take any action. It is unclear whether this was due to an agreement between the Council of Wise Men and the council. At present, it is unclear what impact this incident will have on Fantasia and the outside world.

I have signed another round of mobilization orders to send more young people to the battlefield, or more precisely, to hell. On the square, people surrounded me. I dare not lift my head - I am ashamed to look into the eyes of those mothers and wives. A young lady walked up to me, holding a child. I dare not speak out, I am afraid she will ask me when to send this child to hell - to see his father. She patted my shoulder, 'We can't give up yet.'
