 touhou_GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Entering the fantasy world"
 touhou_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1936, the world was gradually moving towards darkness, and a sudden change silently erupted. A brand new and unknown area has appeared in the Sea of Japan, where not only do humans no different from this world live, but also numerous types of monsters with superpowers. The investigation team dispatched by people was stopped at the edge of the mysterious area, seemingly obstructed by some invisible barrier. But even after such a change, humanity remained immersed in deceit; in Europe, Hitler consolidated his authority and set his sights on regions outside of Germany. Mussolini's Italy continued to embark on bold military adventures, while the Japanese Empire was ready to attack China. Nearly twenty years have passed since the end of the World War, and humanity has yet to learn its lesson, once again turning the world into a powder keg. But this time, with the addition of new members, the direction of the historical wheel will become even more confusing"

 ALI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the early stages of the transformation in the fantasy world, Alice was the first to discover this transformation because she had lost contact with the demon world, and together with the Council of Wise Men, attempted to prevent it. After the failed attempt to prevent the mutation, he was thrown into this world along with Fantasia. As one of the earliest people to discover the mutation, Alice's preparation was not sufficient at all. In the process of preventing the mutation and being thrown into the new world afterwards, Alice lost almost all of her puppet servants. Fortunately, although the magic in this world is rare, it can still meet the needs of survival. Although the materials in this world do not contain magic and the craftsmanship does not have magical elements, it is still possible to make automatic dolls. Alice still has a chance to recover, but it will take time. On the other side of the demon world, everyone was anxious because they suddenly lost contact with Alice. Now their biggest headache is how to hide it from Shenqi, or how to persuade Shenqi not to turn countless worlds upside down just to find Alice"
 VAM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the Skaret family has always been one of the main forces in Fantasia, the rule of Remilia is by no means stable. There is a Blood Clan Council lurking outside, ready to regain power at any time; There is also a strong claim to the title of marquis within, and although everyone understands that she has no intention of seizing power, there are always people with intentions to use her; In terms of military affairs, the Dragon and Tiger Guards, which were previously authorized to be formed by Hong Meiling to confront the Blood Clan Council that the lower level Blood Clan could not resist, seem to have begun to become her private army. Fortunately, it seems that she is still relatively loyal at present; In terms of politics, Pachuli, who has made great contributions to the family, has shown signs of becoming a powerful figure and is gradually taking over the reins of power. There is a subtle trend towards regency, and although her little devil private army is not strong, it is still a force; Fortunately, the presence of the loyal dog Sixteen Nights temporarily relieved her of the need to worry about whether the alcohol was poisonous This fantasy transformation is both an opportunity and a challenge for Remilia, and whether she can seize it depends on herself"
 TEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the fantasy village, the Tengu have always been in a state of internal pressure and external isolation, with severe racial stratification within. Thanks to the nightmare of being enslaved by the ghost tribe in the past, the Tengu still maintain an almost fanatical unity and exclusion. After becoming the largest force in Monster Mountain, they also began to pursue hegemony and began to oppress their fellow countrymen who were previously enslaved by ghosts - the Hetong tribe. The Tengu appears to be powerful and mysterious, with a high degree of cohesion, but the oppressed lower level Tengu and Hetong cannot be without any complaints. With the world entering a period of change and external ideologies surging in, can the heavenly dogs still maintain stability? Where will the lower level heavenly dogs go"
 TEM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Minglian Temple has always been a staunch advocate of equality between humans and monsters, and it has indeed done so. However, the long-standing animosity between humans and monsters cannot be resolved simply by living under the same roof. Although the two sides appear to be harmonious on the surface, there are still ups and downs behind their backs. What kind of catalyst will this mutation become and what kind of reaction will it promote between the two factions"
 RAB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The people of the Eternal Pavilion have long been accustomed to wandering, so they have hardly been affected. However, the demon rabbits who have been living a reclusive life in the lost bamboo forest are completely unable to calm down, especially the leader of the demon rabbits, Emperor Inaba. Perhaps relying on luck, experience, or something else, he smelled a strange breath and began actively guiding the change. On the other hand, the Moon people who had lost their power began to lose control of their opponents, and Lingxian was accepted by the monster rabbits. The Moon's mind also began to try to adapt to the new environment, but the long time gave her wisdom and made it difficult for her to adapt to the new changes, so she still needed time. At the time of entering the world, the secret lunar communication route located in the Eternal Pavilion lost control and bypassed the Great Barrier of Boli, directly connecting to the outside world. Eternal Pavilion not only lost contact with the lunar support forces, but also had to directly face external threats. What will be the future of Eternal Pavilion"
 OPP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The world's transformation has even affected the other shore. The other shore was completely thrown onto land and lost contact with the Ten Halls of Yama. As the only Yama still present on the other shore, Four Seasons rightfully became the supreme ruler. On the day Four Seasons ascended to power, he issued the highly controversial law of 'Reincarnation of the Undead in the World'. According to the law, all undead must work on the other side and the White Jade Tower before entering the underworld to perform pre redemption. Siji is well aware that these undead do not come from this world. It is better to say that there are no undead in this world, but Siji himself is not sure where these undead come from or where they go"
 SSS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since entering the fantasy world, Shouya Shrine has become a strong competitor to Hakurei Shrine, almost taking away all of Hakurei's faith. However, Shouya has never been able to secure the coveted position of guardian of the fantasy world, and from the situation, they do not intend to give up this opportunity"
 MLS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "禩his morning, when Marissa knocked on the door for the first time and came in, I knew I had much more trouble than my shop being smashed to pieces\" By Xianglin Diary (On the Day of the World's Transformation)"
 KAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Compared to other races in Monster Mountain, the individual strength of Hetong is relatively weak, so he chose to strengthen himself through equipment. However, in this process, the strengthening of strength was gradually replaced by the pursuit of the unknown and the pleasure of creation. Nowadays, Hetong is simply a group of technology thugs who do not care about anything for the sake of science. Hetong was oppressed by both the ghost tribe and the heavenly dog. At first, he rose up to resist, but he became addicted to technology (bombing the laboratory), and later began to enjoy himself. If it weren't for this mutation, where the heavenly dog seriously hindered Hetong's exploration of the unknown, perhaps this situation would never have changed"
 HUM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The people who were most affected by this mutation were the ones inside. They found that there were still so many compatriots outside who would not be oppressed by monsters. In addition, after the mutation, the power of monsters was greatly weakened. Many people inside the people began to try to get rid of the influence of monsters. However, since there are those who pursue independence, there are also those who fear change and are content with the status quo, and the Wise Council also supports these stubborn factions behind the scenes. At the same time, there are also many people who sympathize with the monsters and have maintained friendly relations with them. But no matter what, this time there will be a huge change in people's lives"
 HEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The ghost tribe only cares about two things; alcohol and battle. This mutation is the same for them everywhere, whether it's in Gensokyo or outside. It's better to say that the ghost tribe actually enjoys their current state more; more types of alcohol and more opponents"
 HAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the entrance to the underworld, Baiyu Tower began to play the role of a hell after abandoning the old hell on the other side. It also holds a certain position in Fantasia due to the support of Bayun Zi, serving as a link between Fantasia and the other side. After the outbreak of the mutation, although the other side quickly regained stability, the control of the White Jade Tower by the other side without the Ten Halls of Hell was greatly reduced. This was an opportunity for Bayunzi and Youyouzi to escape from the other side and control the underworld, but things were not that simple"
 EVI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Fairy doesn't care about so-called mutations, as long as they have fun, they don't care about anything else"
 DLD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Jue monsters have been diligently managing the old hell, whether it was after it was abandoned by the other side or after the arrival of the ghost tribe. They paid a huge price to obtain and establish an underground nuclear furnace for the old hell, filling the energy gap left by the other side's abandonment. After the other side attempted to seize the underground nuclear furnace, they completely broke away from the other side. The number of Jue monsters has been continuously decreasing, and coupled with their ability to read minds, no one is willing to deal with them. In order to relieve loneliness, the Spirit Hall has raised a large number of monsters, including very powerful types. Although it was not the original purpose, the Warcraft did make significant contributions to protecting the Earth Spirit Hall"
 DES_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Temple of Divine Spirits was originally located in a different realm and was greatly influenced by the world's entry. Some buildings and objects that originally relied on special phenomena in the other realm collapsed, and numerous artifacts painstakingly crafted and collected by the necromancers were also destroyed in this catastrophe. Their archenemy, the Temple of Destiny, was watching closely from the side. Now they must take action, for survival, for the glory of the temple of gods"
 BLI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "If you have to choose a force that can represent Gensokyo, then it is Hakurei Shrine. Both the Hakurei Shrine and Gensokyo were established to resist external threats and maintain stability internally. Hakurei priestesses have always been regarded as the guardians of Gensokyo and hold a high position within it. However, this mutation was a huge blow to Boli's beliefs, as entering the fantasy world meant that the fantasy land was no longer independent of the world. Fortunately, although there is a breach in the Unyuan Tomb, the Hakurei Great Barrier still plays a role. Fantasia and the outside world can only be connected through the entrance and exit of Hakurei Shrine, the breach in Unyuan Tomb, and the other shore that is not within the Great Barrier. The barrier reaction at the Eternal Pavilion is also a bit strange, but Bayi Eirin refuses to accept the investigation and promises that everything is under control. Where will the future of Boli and Fantasia go"
